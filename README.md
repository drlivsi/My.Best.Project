# My Best Project: 1.25kk users per month

I have several pet projects and would like to show one of them. Instead of code, I will describe the project and show anonymous statistics.

My project allows you to send a postcard to a friend and consists of 4 sites in different languages, a mobile application, and a service for sending push notifications.

<h2>Websites</h2>
